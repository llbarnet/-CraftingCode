# CraftingCode
  This is a personal professional website for Katrina Kennett and Lauren Barnet. It is a testing ground for building new skills while also allowing a platform to showcase our code and professional skills.
  It also allows a space to show our passion for crafting with a planned database for personal craft projects.

## Implementation
  This site currently deploys from Netlify through github. It currently only uses HTML and CSS.

## Future Plans
  Current plans for the site are to add a database with admin user capabilities using rails or flask frameworks, update the CSS to responsive CSS Grid, and to add JQuery for a better UIX.
