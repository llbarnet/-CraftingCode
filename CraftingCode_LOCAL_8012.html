        <h2>Lauren Barnet</h2>
       <p> I am a current Microbiologist in Bozeman but have felt the need and interest for a change.</p>
       <p> For the last year, I have been learning how to code and am wanting to immerse myself more into the coding community. I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer for three years in Tanzania, East Africa, teaching science and math to high school students in a remote village. I spent my last year of service on a clinical study with Johns Hopkins University working on intervention/prevention methods for sex workers and HIV.</p>
